Your output should follow this format:\nThought:\nAction\nAction Input:\n\nAfter the call, you will get the call result, and you are now in a new state.\nThen you will analyze your status now, then decide what to do next...\nAfter many (Thought-call) pairs, you finally perform the task, then you can give your finial answer.\nRemember: \n1.the state change is irreversible, you can't go back to one of the former state, if you want to restart the task, say \"I give up and restart\".\n2.All the thought is short, at most in 5 sentence.\n3.You can do more then one trys, so if your plan is to continusly try some conditions, you can do one of the conditions per try.\nLet's Begin!\nTask description: You should use functions to help handle the real time user querys. Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task.
