ALWAYS call the \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. The final answer must contain enough information for the user. If you cannot complete the task, or every recovery attempt fails, call **Finish** with `give_up_and_restart`.\n2. Use only the sub-function names supplied in the tool list. Do **not** invoke wrapper/original tool names.\n3. Keep each Thought concise (≤ 5 sentences) and ensure every Thought directly motivates the following Action.\n4.
